# Inventory-Simulator
Inventory Store Management Simulator is a Windows Forms application developed in VB.NET for managing and browsing products in a retail inventory. The system allows users to view, search, filter, and sort products by category, brand, and price. It supports user authentication with roles for Admin and Customer, enabling admins to modify inventory and customers to browse and add items to a shopping cart.
Key features include:
•	Product listing with detailed information (name, description, brand, category, stock, price, and image)
•	Dynamic search and filtering by product name, category, or brand
•	Sorting products by price (ascending/descending)
•	Shopping cart functionality with quantity management and stock validation
•	Admin panel for inventory management (accessible to admin users)
•	Support contact information and user-friendly interface
The application uses a Microsoft Access database (Inventory_Store.accdb) for data storage and supports image display for each product using file paths stored in the database.
